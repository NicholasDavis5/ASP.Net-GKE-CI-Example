# Steps:
- Set up a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project and enable the necessary APIs
- Create a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster in your GCP project
- Install and configure Helm on your local machine
- Create a Helm chart for your ASP.NET application
- Build and push your Docker image to GCP Container Registry
- Configure GitHub Actions to automate deployment
- Test and monitor your deployment

## 1. Set up a GCP project and enable the necessary APIs
Before you can deploy your ASP.NET application to GKE, you need to set up a GCP project and enable the necessary APIs. You can follow the official documentation to create a new project or use an existing one. Then, you can enable the Kubernetes Engine API and Container Registry API from the API Library.

## 2. Create a GKE cluster in your GCP project
Next, you need to create a GKE cluster in your GCP project. You can follow the official documentation to create a new cluster with the desired specifications, such as number of nodes, machine types, and zones. Or select autopilot and allow google to manage your cluster for you. 

## 3. Install and configure Helm on your local machine
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications. You can follow the official documentation to install Helm on your local machine and configure it to connect to your GKE cluster.

## 4. Create a Helm chart for your ASP.NET application
A Helm chart is a collection of files that define how to deploy and configure your application on Kubernetes. You can use the helm create command to create a new Helm chart template for your ASP.NET application, and then customize it to suit your needs. For example, you can specify the Docker image name and tag, ingress rules, and environment variables. You can follow the official documentation to learn more about Helm charts. To start though run `helm create my-app-chart`.

## 5. Build and push your Docker image to GCP Container Registry
Before you can deploy your ASP.NET application to GKE, you need to build a Docker image for your application and push it to GCP Container Registry. You can follow the official documentation to build and push your Docker image. Make sure to tag the image with the registry name and version, such as gcr.io/my-project/my-app:v1.0.0.

## 6. Configure GitHub Actions to automate deployment
GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that allows you to automate your software development workflows. You can create a new GitHub Actions workflow to automate the deployment process when merging to the main branch. You can use the GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/setup-gcloud action to authenticate with your GCP service account and set the necessary environment variables, such as the project ID, cluster name, and region. You can use the GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/setup-kubectl action to install and configure kubectl on the workflow runner. Finally, you can use the GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/helm-deploy action to deploy your Helm chart to the GKE cluster.

## 7. Test and monitor your deployment
Once your workflow completes successfully, you can test and monitor your deployment to ensure that everything is running as expected. You can use `kubectl` or the GKE Console to verify that your ASP.NET application is running as expected, and you can also set up monitoring and logging tools, such as Stackdriver, to monitor the health and performance of your deployment. Additionally, you can use the GitHub Actions logs and status checks to track the progress and outcome of your deployments.

By following these steps, you should now have a fully automated deployment pipeline for your ASP.NET application on GKE using Helm charts and GitHub Actions. This will allow you to easily deploy updates and changes to your application with confidence and ease.
